# CoTS Use Case Training Workshop
## 23 January 2024

## Goal

To use the GBR Data Management System (DMS) to extract and analyse data (point or time series data) from selected datasets provided by the DMS

## Case Studies

We will be working on the following use case examples: 

1. Extract eReef model time series data for a selected point (coordinates) or reef (reef name), using hydrological and biochemical products.
2. Extract and calculate average values for eReef model variables for an area defined by a shape file withing an specified time frame
3. Extract a time series of values from LTMP/MMP modelled output for a particular reef or a list of reefs
